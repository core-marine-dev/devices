# Devices repo — Working Status (resume here)

> **Living handoff doc ("cuaderno de bitácora").** If a session ends mid-work (AI provider
> limit, context loss, switching agents), a new agent — any provider — reads THIS file to
> continue. Everything authoritative lives in the repo, not in any tool's memory.
>
> **🔄 Maintenance rule (for ANY agent working in this repo):** after every meaningful change —
> a refactor step, a locked decision, a commit, or a shift in what's next — check whether this
> doc is still accurate and, if not, **update it in the same turn**. Do NOT wait for the end of
> the session: limits hit without warning. Keeping "Where we are now", "Next steps" and "HEAD"
> current is the entire purpose of this file.
>
> **Last updated:** 2026-07-08 · **Branch:** `dev` (HEAD not pushed) · Repo was idle
> 2025-12-15 → 2026-07-08.
>
> **Steps 1-3 complete + dependency refresh done.** Next: CMA rollout, Result pattern.

## How to use this doc

1. Read this top-to-bottom, then the linked docs. Newer docs win over older ones.
2. Authoritative context (all in-repo, provider-agnostic):
   - Repo rules for agents: [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md) (≤80 lines, points here)
   - What the repo is / layout / `misc/` convention: [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md)
   - Per-package state + known issues: [`docs/PACKAGES.md`](PACKAGES.md)
   - The target output format: [`docs/CMA.md`](CMA.md)
   - Commands: [`docs/COMMANDS.md`](COMMANDS.md) · Stack/CI: [`docs/TOOLING.md`](TOOLING.md)
   - pnpm migration (done): [`docs/PNPM-MIGRATION.md`](PNPM-MIGRATION.md)
3. Working method the user (cru) expects: **discuss decisions before coding, one step at a
   time; this repo feeds the Tracker product, so output-format changes are breaking changes.**

## Mission

Refresh the whole monorepo in strokes:

1. **CMA format rollout** — every parser emits the same output shape ([`docs/CMA.md`](CMA.md)).
   Today only `thelmabiotel-tblive` conforms.
2. ~~**pnpm migration**~~ — ✅ DONE (2026-07-08). See [`docs/PNPM-MIGRATION.md`](PNPM-MIGRATION.md).
3. ~~**Linter + formatter migration**~~ — ✅ DONE (2026-07-08). ESLint flat config with
   @stylistic + sonarjs + perfectionist plugins (mirrors Tracker repo).
4. ~~**Documentation**~~ — ✅ DONE (2026-07-08). `docs/CodeStyle.md` + AGENTS.md code-style
   section + lint→tsc→test run order codified.
5. ~~**Dependency refresh**~~ — ✅ DONE (2026-07-08). TypeScript 6.0.3, Vitest 4.x,
   Valibot 1.4.2, @schemasjs/* latest, tsup 8.5.1 (patched), safe dep bumps.
6. **Result pattern** — adopt `Result<T,E>` no-exceptions-as-control-flow (from Tracker repo).
   Later track, after CMA.

## Done

- **2026-07-08 — full repo revision + docs reset.** Three exploration passes (packages,
  uncommitted work, tooling/CI) written into `docs/` (was empty); `AGENTS.md` slimmed to a
  ≤80-line index; this STATUS.md created as the handoff log.
- **2026-07-08 — uncommitted-pile triage (was ~46 dirty files, cru's call on categories):**
  - **`misc/` convention adopted** (gitignored, like the Tracker repo): raw sensor data,
    scratch harnesses, drafts and parked work must never be committed. Moved there: the root
    CMA harness (`misc/tests/` — cma.ts draft, SBG corpus, P08-Trident), `misc/todo/`
    (ublox-ubx + vectornav scaffolds, never tracked), sbg-ecom-nodered draft tests + raw
    bin/csv samples (`misc/drafts/`, `misc/data/sbg/`), tblive runtime outputs
    (`misc/data/tblive/`), the unused `receiver` helper node, `drafts.excalidraw.png`, and
    superseded design drafts (`misc/archive/`).
  - **Deleted** 14 untracked npm-generated `package-lock.json` files (packages' test folders,
    templates).
  - **Restored** the root `package-lock.json` (its deletion was uncommitted and unexplained;
    we stay on npm until the pnpm migration). `npm install` then refreshed it (committed with
      the sbg-ecom bump).
  - **Verified then committed** the pre-idle threads: septentrio-sbf test modernization
    (`getFrames()→parseData()`, `ErrorCode→ERROR_CODE`, `Mode→MODE`) — **54/54 tests pass**;
    sbg-ecom dep bump + vitest `include` + example fixes (trailing `}` in template strings —
    also fixed a real one in `example_csv.ts` map keys) — lint + build clean;
    septentrio-sbf-nodered sibling bump `^1.0.1`; tblive-nodered expanded docker flows +
    its previously-untracked docker components mirror.
- **2026-07-08 — pnpm migration (step 1 of refactor):**
  - Root `package.json`: `packageManager: pnpm@11.10.0`, dropped npm `workspaces` + `main`,
    rewrote ~36 proxy scripts to `pnpm --filter @coremarine/<pkg> run <action>`.
  - `.npmrc` (`engine-strict=true`) + `pnpm-workspace.yaml` (`strictDepBuilds: true` +
    `allowBuilds: { esbuild: true }`) — supply-chain hardened (mirrors Tracker repo).
  - 5 tracked `package-lock.json` removed; `package-lock.json` added to `.gitignore`.
  - Sibling deps → `workspace:^` (norsub-emru + all 5 nodered packages).
  - septentrio-sbf `types` hack removed — `gpstime.d.ts` is now a local ambient declaration
    (`declare module 'gpstime'`) included in `tsconfig.json` (no more copying to root
    `node_modules/@types/`).
  - valibot ERESOLVE dep rot fixed: `nmea-parser` `valibot: 1.1.0` → `^1.4.0`; `norsub-emru`
    peer `valibot: 1.1.0` → `>=1.0.0` (valibot 1.4.2 now installs cleanly).
  - 10 CI workflows + 2 templates rewritten: `pnpm/action-setup@v4`, `cache: 'pnpm'`,
    `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`, `pnpm publish --filter --no-git-checks`.
  - Verified: all 5 builds pass, all 4 test suites with specs pass (nmea 60/60, septentrio
    54/54, tblive 134/134, norsub 8/8; sbg-ecom has no specs — pre-existing).
  - Docs updated: TOOLING, COMMANDS, PNPM-MIGRATION (marked done), CONTRIBUTING, AGENTS.
- **2026-07-08 — ESLint flat config migration (step 2 of refactor):**
  - Root `eslint.config.js` with 4 plugins: typescript-eslint, @stylistic, eslint-plugin-sonarjs,
    eslint-plugin-perfectionist (mirrors Tracker repo). House style: no-semi, single-quotes,
    2-space, K&R braces, arrowParens: always. Sonar thresholds: max-lines-per-function 50,
    cyclomatic-complexity 10, cognitive-complexity 15 (tests exempt from max-lines). Import
    ordering: `// built-in` → `// installed` → `// coded` via perfectionist partitionByComment.
  - ts-standard removed; per-package `ts-standard`/`eslintConfig` blocks removed.
  - `lint` = `eslint`, `format` = `eslint --fix`; root `lint`/`lint:fix` scripts added.
  - `.vscode/settings.json` updated: ESLint flat config integration, `source.fixAll.eslint`
    on save, dropped `standard.*` settings.
  - Per-package `tsconfig.json` updated to include `tests/**/*` (for projectService).
  - ~2596 auto-fixable violations fixed (quotes, semicolons, trailing commas, indentation).
  - ~180 non-fixable violations triaged:
    - Mechanical fixes: split multi-statement lines (66), unused vars/imports (25), test
      assertion specificity (20).
    - Complexity violations (max-lines-per-function, cyclomatic-complexity, cognitive-complexity):
      inline-disabled with `-- CMA refactor will address` comments.
    - Sonar findings: `===` type-mismatch (fixed a real type bug in nmea-parser/sentences.ts;
      intentional ones disabled with comments), `Math.random()` in tests (disabled), TODO tags
      (disabled), empty collections (disabled), hardcoded IP (disabled), dead stores (removed).
  - Verified: all 5 builds pass, all 4 test suites pass (nmea 60/60, septentrio 54/54,
    tblive 134/134, norsub 8/8). `pnpm lint` clean across the whole monorepo.
  - Docs updated: TOOLING (linting section), COMMANDS, CONTRIBUTING, AGENTS.
- **2026-07-08 — documentation (step 3 of refactor):**
  - `docs/CodeStyle.md` created — dev explainer with rationale + examples for: formatting,
    import groups, arrow functions, one-statement-per-line, small-function thresholds,
    validation & types (Valibot/SchemasJS), per-package five-file structure, tooling commands,
    inline eslint-disable policy. Adapted from the Tracker repo's CodeStyle.md, tailored for
    Node/monorepo (no Bun built-ins, no Result pattern yet — that's a later track).
  - `AGENTS.md` — added "Code style (enforced)" condensed checklist section (73 lines total,
    under the 80-line cap) + CodeStyle.md added to docs map.
  - `docs/STATUS.md` — updated to reflect step 3 done.
- **2026-07-08 — dependency refresh (step 5 of refactor):**
  - **TypeScript 5.9.3 → 6.0.3.** Root `tsconfig.json` replaced the annotated starter template
    with a clean modern config: `moduleResolution: "bundler"`, `moduleDetection: "force"`,
    `types: ["node"]`, `noFallthroughCasesInSwitch`, `noImplicitOverride`. Per-package
    tsconfigs updated. `norsub-emru` needed `override` on `parseData()`.
  - **tsup 8.5.0 → 8.5.1 (patched).** tsup injects `baseUrl: "."` in its DTS build, which TS 6
    deprecated (TS5101). Patched via `pnpm patch` to skip the injection when using
    `moduleResolution: "bundler"` (see `patches/tsup@8.5.1.patch`).
  - **Vitest 3.2.4 → 4.1.10** + `@vitest/coverage-v8` 3.2.4 → 4.1.10. Zero code changes needed.
  - **Valibot** — `nmea-parser` `valibot: ^1.4.0` → `1.4.2`; `@valibot/to-json-schema`
    `1.3.0` → `1.7.1`; `@schemasjs/valibot-numbers` → `1.1.1`; `@schemasjs/validator` → `2.0.5`.
  - **Other deps:** `@types/node` 24.8.1 → 26.0.1, `mocha` 11.7.4 → 11.7.6, `chai` 6.2.0 → 6.2.2,
    `deep-equal-in-any-order` 2.1.0 → 2.2.0, `node-red-node-test-helper` 0.3.5 → 0.3.6.
  - Verified: all 5 builds pass, all 4 test suites pass (nmea 60/60, septentrio 54/54,
    tblive 134/134, norsub 8/8), `pnpm lint` clean, `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` clean.
  - Docs updated: TOOLING, STATUS.

## Where we are now

Steps 1-5 of the refactor are complete and committed on `dev` (not pushed): pnpm migration,
ESLint migration, documentation, and dependency refresh (TS 6.0.3 + Vitest 4.x + Valibot
1.4.2 + safe bumps). Next up: **CMA rollout**, then **Result pattern**.

No parser code has been refactored yet — CMA rollout and Result pattern are still pending.

## Decisions (locked unless cru says otherwise)

- **CMA draft of record is [`docs/CMA.md`](CMA.md) §Current draft** (timestamp = epoch ms,
  `protocol.version` required) — open questions listed there must be settled before rollout.
- **Docs live in `docs/`, one small doc per concern; `AGENTS.md` stays ≤80 lines** (index only).
- **`misc/` is gitignored** — raw sensor captures and dev helpers are never committed.
- **pnpm migration is done** — no more npm in the repo (except Node-RED Dockerfiles, deferred).
- **ESLint sonar thresholds: strict from day one** (Option A: max-lines-per-function 50,
  cyclomatic-complexity 10, cognitive-complexity 15; tests exempt from max-lines).
- **Result pattern will be adopted** as a later track, after linter + CMA.

## Next steps (in order)

1. **Push `dev`** when cru is ready (publishing only happens on merge to `main`, so pushing
   `dev` is safe).
2. **CMA rollout** — lock the [`docs/CMA.md`](CMA.md) open questions with cru first, then
   start with **sbg-ecom** (pre-release 0.0.1, no tests to break, SBG→CMA design work
   already exists in `misc/tests/sbg/`); then septentrio-sbf, nmea-parser (+norsub-emru),
   and align thelmabiotel-tblive's extra top-level keys.
3. **Result pattern** — port from Tracker repo (no-exceptions-as-control-flow).
4. **Strictness pass** (deferred) — add `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`,
   `verbatimModuleSyntax` to tsconfig (the tracker has them; needs ~218 code fixes).

## Open threads / known bugs (report before fixing)

- **Dep rot:** resolved for valibot (1.4.2 now installs); other deps still from ~2025 —
  audit during dep refresh.
- `nmea-parser/src/types.ts`: `Float32`/`Float64` types are swapped (each aliases the other's schema).
- `sbg-ecom` has **zero test specs** (only fixtures) and its CI test step is commented out.
- `thelmabiotel-tblive-nodered` has a `test` script but **no mocha specs** (`No test files found`).
- All 5 nodered CI workflows have their test jobs commented out — they publish untested.
- nmea-parser ships a committed `legacy/` folder + stray root files (`morenmea.tss`).
- Nodered sibling dep ranges now use `workspace:^` (was inconsistent `^exact` vs `>=`).
- `main: index.js` removed from root `package.json` (was pointing to a non-existent file).
- P08-Trident harness (`misc/tests/p08trident/`) status unknown — ask cru if still live.
